### ‚ùì What if the Code of Conduct is violated?

**Online:**

If you experience any form of abuse, harassment, discrimination, or feel unsafe, please contact Wendel Marques (WTM UFG Lead). If the Lead is the person you want to report, please contact Amanda Mazini (Community Manager, Brazil) or Rodrigo Akira (Regional Leader, Brazil).

**In-Person Events:**

If someone engages in harassing behavior, the organizing team may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offending person or expelling them from the conference and/or groups, with the facts established. In the case of paid events, there will be no refund.
